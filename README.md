# ESG Analysis and Insurance Market Simulation

## Overview
This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing ESG ratings, modeling insurance markets, and simulating agent-based dynamics. The key components include:

- **divergence.py**: Functions for generating ESG ratings data, calculating divergence metrics, and simulating regulatory discontinuities.
- **dynamics.py**: Agent-based modeling of ESG insurance markets, including firm behaviors, rating agencies, and insurers.
- **efficiency.py**: Analytical tools for solving equilibrium disclosure strategies, performing welfare decomposition, and conducting Monte Carlo simulations.

## Installation
